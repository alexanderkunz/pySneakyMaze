A python library for generating two dimensional mazes. Mazes are saved in
boolean arrays to mark wall (False) or floor (True). Several algorithms
are implemented, each with its own pros and cons. The faster ones usually
have a lower quality than the slower ones. Lower quality means, that the
mazes are more biased. A good start for generating high quality mazes is
the Prim2D-Algorithm, which has a very good quality-performance ratio.

Three dimensional and infinite mazes are planned.
